#### there are merge issues in this branch. Take the changes from this branch and add them to a new branch based on upstream master  
> Initial repo scan can be slow in larger repos, but only happens once.  

To complete this request, the only files that are likely to need edits are the ones with unresolved merge conflicts when applying your branch on top of upstream/master.

Please add to the chat:
- Every file currently reported by Git as unmerged (with conflicts).

You can list exactly those files with this command:
```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

#### What's wrong? Fix  

The script is fine; the error is because the file isnâ€™t marked executable. In fish, invoking a script by path requires the executable bit, otherwise you must run it via its interpreter.

No code changes needed. Make it executable or invoke it with bash.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/recreate_branch_from_upstream_master.sh
scripts/recreate_branch_from_upstream_master.sh
bash scripts/recreate_branch_from_upstream_master.sh
```
